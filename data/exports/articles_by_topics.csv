"the nitrogen (n) released after a 7-d anaerobic incubation (nan) is a good estimator of the size of the soil n mineralizable pool. however, there is a lack of information on how soil properties and climate affect the apparent field n mineralization (nmin) of this pool. the objective of our study was to develop and validate a simple model to estimate nmin from nan in corn (zea mays l.) and wheat (triticum aestivum l.) fields. to this end, we performed 100 field experiments where we measured nmin, nan, rainfall, temperature (tc), soil texture, ph, soil organic matter (som), and pre-sowing mineral n concentra-tion (ninitial). we performed a stepwise analysis to develop a model to predict nmin using data from 70 sites, while the rest of the data was saved for model validation. the nan ranged from 16 to 94 mg kg–1 while nmin ranged from 22 to 232 kg ha–1. there was a strong association between nan and nmin within regions with similar climate and edaphic properties. however, we could not fit a single significant model to estimate nmin based solely on nan to be used in all regions. by considering other variables besides nan, we developed a model that allowed predicting nmin independently from the site [nmin = –252 + 12.3(tc) + 1.37(nan) + 0.27(rainfall)] (r2 = 0.89, model validation r2 = 0.83). this mod-el could be useful to adjust n fertilizer recommendations for corn and wheat, reducing the economic and environmental impact of fertilization.",0.0016836979,0.0016838451,0.0016838204,0.0016838211,0.49085188,0.0016837782,0.06882564,0.0016837245,0.0016837537,0.001683781,0.4268523,Organic matter mineralization and estimation models
"living roots and their rhizodeposits affect microbial activity and soil carbon (c) and nitrogen (n) mineralization. this so-called rhizosphere priming effect (rpe) has been increasingly recognized recently. however, the magnitude of the rpe and its driving mechanisms remain elusive. here we investigated the rpe of two plant species (soybean and sun ﬂower) grown in two soil types (a farm or a prairie soil) and sampled at two phenological stages (vegetative and mature stages) over an 88-day period in a greenhouse experiment. we measured soil c mineralization using a continuous 13c-labeling method, and quantiﬁed gross n mineralization with a 15n-pool dilution technique. we found that living roots signiﬁcantly enhanced soil c mineralization, by 27 e 245%. this positive rpe on soil c mineralization did not vary between the two soils or the two phenological stages, but was signiﬁcantly greater in sun ﬂower compared to soybean. the magnitude of the rpe was positively correlated with rhizosphere respiration rate across all treatments, suggesting the variation of rpe among treatments was likely caused by variations in root activity and rhizodeposit quantity. moreover, living roots stimulated gross n mineralization rate by 36 e 62% in ﬁve treatments, while they had no signiﬁcant impact in the other three treatments. we also quantiﬁed soil microbial biomass and extracellular enzyme activity when plants were at the vegetative stage. generally, living roots increased microbial biomass carbon by 0 e 28%, b-glucosidase activity by 19 e 56%, and oxidative enzyme activity by 0 e 46%. these results are consistent with the positive rhizosphere effect on soil c (45 e 79%) and n (10 e 52%) mineralization measured at the same period. we also found signiﬁcant positive relationships between b-glucosidase activity and soil c mineralization rates and between oxidative enzyme activity and gross n minerali-zation rates across treatments. these relationships provide clear evidence for the microbial activation hypothesis of rpe. our results demonstrate that root esoilemicrobial interactions can stimulate soil c and n mineralization through rhizosphere effects. the relationships between the rpe and rhizosphere respiration rate and soil enzyme activity can be used for explicit representations of rpe in soil organic matter models.",0.66722363,0.0019344294,0.0019343891,0.0019343928,0.0019343736,0.0019344089,0.0019343802,0.0019344575,0.20978776,0.10751334,0.0019344157,Microbial activity and organic carbon in soil

"baseline soil nitrogen (n) mineralization refers to the plant-available nitrogen (pan) release that accompanies the biologically mediated decomposition of soil organic matter (som). baseline soil n mineralization usually supplies about half of crop n uptake (pages 3–4). although this n is not mentioned explicitly in pacific northwest (pnw) nutrient and fertilizer guides, n fertilizer rate recommendations do account for typical baseline n mineralization amounts. soils that have been heavily manured for many years or are naturally very high in som can supply most of the n required for crop production via mineralization. the rate of baseline soil n mineralization is governed by the quantity and quality of som, as modified by soil moisture and temperature (pages 4–5). annually, about 1% to 3% of the n present in som is mineralized to nitrate (no3). laboratory tests to measure baseline soil n mineralization rate (nmin tests) are often included in soil health assessment packages because they reflect the digestibility of som and the capacity of the microbial community to convert organic n to plant-available forms. many laboratory nmin test methods have been proposed, and a variety of test methods are offered by commercial laboratories. most laboratory tests for n mineralization are useful only as measures of relative changes in soil health. we review four general categories of laboratory tests (pages 6–9): aerobic and anaerobic lab incubations to directly measure mineralized n, soil total n, organic c or som by routine commercial methods, active n fraction of som (hot water, amino sugar and ace protein methods), and active carbon (c) fraction of som (carbon dioxide (co2) “burst” and permanganate c methods). to be useful in managing site-specific n inputs, these laboratory tests must be calibrated to accurately predict actual field n mineralization rates. we describe two methods used in calibration studies to measure n mineralized in the field: the buried bag and the zero n plot methods (pages 10–11).",0.16201116,0.0013176833,0.357402,0.2150062,0.0013177257,0.024201214,0.0013176912,0.0013177133,0.0013177106,0.0013176912,0.23347324,Organic fertilizers and plant ecosystem

"soil organic matter pools are turned over at different rates, but uncertainty persists regarding how the hierarchically organized soil structure controls the mineralization dynamics. to better understand carbon and nitrogen mineralization in undisturbed aggregate classes (coarse aggregates: 2–6.3 mm, fine aggregates: <2 mm), we conducted a long-term (224-days) laboratory incubation experiment. a grassland soil (haplic cambisol) was chosen since its aggregates were not disturbed by tillage. the field-moist aggregate size classes were separated by a gentle dry-sieving method. we monitored the co2–c and nh3–n emissions, nitrogen mineralization, pool sizes of total and salt extractable (0.5 m k2so4) organic carbon and nitrogen, and microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen. by this approach, we could distinguish between the carbon and nitrogen mineralization processes of two soil aggregate size classes, relative to undisturbed bulk soil. the classes showed different aggregate architectures with variously sized subunits, but confirmed the aggregate hierarchy. for both aggregate classes, the recombined sum of respired co2–c per unit of soil organic carbon equaled the bulk soil, proving that our aggregate separation preserved the original aggregates as intact functional units. both aggregate size classes and the bulk soil respired only 4% soil organic carbon throughout the incubation period. the coarse aggregates, which mostly comprised small macroaggregates, mineralized more carbon per unit soil organic carbon than the fine aggregates (composed of microaggregates), indicating a higher bioavailability of soil organic matter in the coarse aggregates. accordingly microbial metabolic efficiency was higher in coarse than in fine aggregates. nitrogen mineralization was higher in fine aggregates than in coarse aggregates, but was impaired by carbon limitation as the incubation experiment proceeded. we conclude that bioavailability of soil organic matter was affected by different aggregate architectures in the different aggregate size classes. the lower bioavailability of soil organic matter in fine aggregates is due to an enhanced stabilization through cation bridging of the dolomitic soil material at the microaggregate level, whereas the higher soil organic matter bioavailability in coarse aggregates is explained by labile organic components at the macroaggregate level.",0.9828464,0.0017153744,0.0017153948,0.0017153486,0.0017154125,0.0017153271,0.0017153424,0.0017153323,0.0017153259,0.001715316,0.0017154264,Microbial activity and organic carbon in soil
