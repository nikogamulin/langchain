2016 Bimuller et al - Carbon and nitrogen mineralization in hierarchically structured aggregates of different size.pdf,Carbon and nitrogen mineralization in hierarchically structured aggregates of different size,"soil organic matter pools are turned over at different rates, but uncertainty persists regarding how the hierarchically organized soil structure controls the mineralization dynamics. to better understand carbon and nitrogen mineralization in undisturbed aggregate classes (coarse aggregates: 2–6.3 mm, fine aggregates: <2 mm), we conducted a long-term (224-days) laboratory incubation experiment. a grassland soil (haplic cambisol) was chosen since its aggregates were not disturbed by tillage. the field-moist aggregate size classes were separated by a gentle dry-sieving method. we monitored the co2–c and nh3–n emissions, nitrogen mineralization, pool sizes of total and salt extractable (0.5 m k2so4) organic carbon and nitrogen, and microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen. by this approach, we could distinguish between the carbon and nitrogen mineralization processes of two soil aggregate size classes, relative to undisturbed bulk soil. the classes showed different aggregate architectures with variously sized subunits, but confirmed the aggregate hierarchy. for both aggregate classes, the recombined sum of respired co2–c per unit of soil organic carbon equaled the bulk soil, proving that our aggregate separation preserved the original aggregates as intact functional units. both aggregate size classes and the bulk soil respired only 4% soil organic carbon throughout the incubation period. the coarse aggregates, which mostly comprised small macroaggregates, mineralized more carbon per unit soil organic carbon than the fine aggregates (composed of microaggregates), indicating a higher bioavailability of soil organic matter in the coarse aggregates. accordingly microbial metabolic efficiency was higher in coarse than in fine aggregates. nitrogen mineralization was higher in fine aggregates than in coarse aggregates, but was impaired by carbon limitation as the incubation experiment proceeded. we conclude that bioavailability of soil organic matter was affected by different aggregate architectures in the different aggregate size classes. the lower bioavailability of soil organic matter in fine aggregates is due to an enhanced stabilization through cation bridging of the dolomitic soil material at the microaggregate level, whereas the higher soil organic matter bioavailability in coarse aggregates is explained by labile organic components at the macroaggregate level.","soil organic matter pools are turned over at different rates, but uncertainty persists regarding how the hierarchically organized soil structure

2023 Breza et al - Complex crop rotations improve organic nitrogen cycling.pdf,Complex crop rotations improve organic nitrogen cycling,"nitrogen (n) availability in agroecosystems is often poorly coupled to plant n uptake, leading to inefficient fertilizer use and environmental losses. building soil organic n pools and enhancing internal recycling of n with crop rotations while reducing synthetic inputs may help improve n use efficiency. the organic n pool could be a valuable source of n that could help farmers reduce reliance on large inorganic n inputs if controls on its availability were better understood. while we know that the breakdown of high-molecular weight organic n compounds is the rate-limiting step to accessing bioavailable n from organic sources in natural ecosystems, there has been little work in agroecosystems to identify how management influences this inflection point in the n cycle. to provide insight into how growers can manage the organic n pool to reduce fertilizer input, we examined gross protein depolymerization rates within an agricultural context. specifically, we investigated 1) how crop rotations affect organic n pools and alter the rate of organic n cycling, and 2) whether inorganic n fertilization enhances, has no effect, or suppresses soil n cycling responses to crop rotation. to test this, we measured gross rates of protein depolymerization, amino acid consumption, mineralization, and ammonium consumption using 15n isotope pool dilution assays on soils collected from a long-term crop complexity experiment near mead, ne, usa. treatments sampled included both 0 kg and 180 kg n ha 1 fertilization levels in continuous corn, corn-soybean, and corn-soybean-sorghum-oat/clover rotations. we found that higher cropping complexity coupled with zero fertilization increased gross depolymerization and amino acid consumption rates by 193% and 93%, respectively, relative to fertilized, monocrop plots. gross mineralization was 2.7 and 3.9x higher in complex rotations than corn-soybean and continuous corn rotations, respectively, while ammonium consumption was 4x higher in fertilized plots than unfertilized plots across all cropping regimes. we show that within our study system internal n cycling is stimulated by cropping system complexity; however, n fertilization suppresses some of the benefits of temporal crop diversification. balancing reduced mineral fertilizer application rates with increased cropping complexity has the potential to promote internal n cycling while minimizing n losses in agroecosystems.","nitrogen (n) availability in agroecosystems is often poorly coupled to plant n uptake, leading to inefficient fertilizer use and environmental losses. building soil organic n pools and enhancing internal recycling of n with crop rotations while reducing synthetic inputs may help improve n use efficiency. the organic n pool could be a valuable source of n that could help farmers reduce reliance on large inorganic n inputs if controls on its availability were better understood. while we know that the breakdown of high-molecular weight organic n compounds is the rate-limiting step to accessing bioavailable n from organic sources in natural ecosystems, there has been little work in agroecosystems to identify how management influences this inflection point in the n cycle. to provide insight into how growers can manage the organic n pool to reduce fertilizer input, we examined gross protein depolymerization rates within an agricultural context. specifically, we investigated 1) how crop rotations affect organic n pools and alter the rate of organic n cycling, and 2) whether inorganic n fertilization enhances, has no effect, or suppresses soil n cycling responses to crop rotation. to test this, we measured gross rates of protein depolymerization, amino acid consumption, mineralization, and ammonium consumption using 15n isotope pool dilution assays on soils collected from a long-term crop complexity experiment near mead, ne, usa. treatments sampled included both 0 kg and 180 kg n ha 1 fertilization levels in continuous corn, corn-soybean, and corn-soybean-sorghum-oat/clover rotations. we found that higher cropping complexity coupled with zero fertilization increased gross depolymerization and amino acid consumption rates by 193% and 93%, respectively, relative to fertilized, monocrop plots. gross mineralization was 2.7 and 3.9x higher in complex rotations than corn-soybean and continuous corn rotations, respectively, while ammonium consumption was 4x higher in fertilized plots than unfertilized plots across all cropping regimes. we show that within our study system internal n cycling is stimulated by cropping system complexity;
