# LangChain Python Examples

## Project Title
LangChain: Python Implementation Examples

## Project Overview
This repository contains example implementations of LangChain, a language processing and generation framework. The purpose of this repository is to provide users with practical, hands-on demonstrations of how to use LangChain in various applications. All the examples are provided in Jupyter Notebook format, stored in the `notebooks` folder.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Python programming.
- Familiarity with natural language processing (NLP) concepts and techniques.
- Experience working with Jupyter Notebooks.

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/langchain-python-examples.git

2. Change to the project directory:

cd langchain-python-examples

3. Create a virtual environment (optional, but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate

4. Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

## Usage
1. In the Jupyter Notebook dashboard, navigate to the `notebooks` folder.
2. Open any example notebook to explore the implementation and follow the instructions provided.
3. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and see the results.

## Code Structure & Organization
- `notebooks/`: Contains the Jupyter Notebooks with example implementations of LangChain.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages for running the example notebooks.
